    The service uses a number of platforms that are offered, kindly, by other companies free of charge. It is only
    because of this that this service can be provided free of charge. See the <a href="https://github.com/laingsimon/courage_scores/wiki/credits">Credits</a> page for more

<p>

    this will be communicated in advance to the custodians.
</p>
<p>
    Inappropriate use may also cause this service to be taken offline if it results in an increase in running cost
    financially on in the time required to maintain the operability of the service.
