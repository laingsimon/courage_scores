            <p>
            In 2006, the teams from ‘The Waldegrave Arms’ in Chewton Mendip were playing their Thursday night darts in the Chew Valley league which had been running for an incredible 50 years and more. But in recent times, despite increasing coverage from Sky TV, darts was struggling and the wide rural area covered by the league meant teams were finding it hard to travel the long distances the fixtures threw up.

            Allan Clarke, Jon Green, Lee Taylor and Geoff Sheppard of ‘The Waldegrave A’ team decided that running a more local league would be more advantageous for travelling and an opportunity to create a new format that would make it easier for teams to stay together and even give more chances for new or younger players to start playing. It was hoped that every player from top of the league to the bottom could get something out of playing in the league.
